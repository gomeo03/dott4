Federico Gatti scored the only goal as Juventus edged defending champions Napoli to move top of Serie A.

The defender scored a late winner last Friday against Monza and followed that up with another decisive strike, heading home in the 51st minute.

Napoli had the better of the first half but couldn't make their chances count.

Victor Osimhen had the opportunity to equalise but was unable to capitalise on Wojciech Szczesny's poor kick.

And while Lewandowski headed in an equaliser from Raphinha's corner to draw Xavi's side level seven minutes later, the visitors always carried a considerable threat on the counter.

Spain Under-21 left-back Gutierrez restored their lead with a surging run and left-foot finish into the left corner five minutes before the break.

Fernandez looked to have rounded off the scoring in the 80th minute with a fine strike from Stuani's flick-on after he had skipped past Barca defender Jules Kounde.
